### Why DFX Tweaker?
Because I needed a small tool to make some changes in Windows, and I came across AikonCWD Script, a small tool that did what I wanted.

However, the tool needed an internet connection for most of its functions, and I wanted to do something like that, but work without internet right out of the box. So the idea of ​​making this project came up, of course, being as transparent as possible about the existence of Aikon and its fantastic script.
