DFX WinTweaks is a simple tool that helps you learn about your computer system and make adjustments to your Windows operating system that go beyond what Microsoft typically allows. It's a work in progress, so new features will be added over time.

**WARNING: I'm not responsible for any issues that might happen on your system. The changes made by DFX WinTweaks are generally minor registry tweaks or service disabling, but use it cautiously.**

**If your security software/browser flags DFX WinTweaks as potentially harmful, you can make an exception for it and trying to run it again. This might be due to an option that can interfere with Microsoft Defender while it is running. Disabling Microsoft Defender might require you to restart your computer in Safe Mode.**

## üêá Online features
DFX WinTweaks doesn't need an internet connection to function, except for some online options like reporting issues or visiting the DFX WinTweaks website on GitHub.

## üíª System Requirements
DFX WinTweaks works on Windows 7 and newer versions. Windows Vista, XP, and older systems are not supported.

**If you use Windows 7 or Windows 8.x, read [this](https://ivandfx.github.io/DFXWinTweaks/posts/fin-sunsetting-nt6.html)**

## üí± Modified Versions
You can modify the tool to make it work on older Windows versions, but there's no guarantee that everything will work as intended.

Keep in mind that DFX WinTweaks might have occasional bugs and problems, i'm actively working to fix everything.

## üîÜ Language Availability

## üßÄ Why DFX WinTweaks?
I created DFX WinTweaks because I needed a way to disable Windows Update and Defender. I found AikonCWD W10 Script, a similar tool with more options, but it required an internet connection for most features. I wanted something similar but functional offline. That's why I started this project, and I want to give credit to AikonCWD and their script.

If you want the AikonCWD Script, you can find it by scrolling down.

## üß≠ AikonCWD W10 Script
All releases up to version 1.11.2 ESR were based on AikonCWD W10 Script. You can download it [**here**](https://github.com/aikoncwd/win10script) - **(Spanish)**

If you like DFX WinTweaks, credit goes to [**AikonCWD**](https://github.com/aikoncwd) for creating the script that started everything.

## ‚õ≤ Source Code
While DFX WinTweaks is Open Source, it kind of doesn't have any source code, because you can easily download any release and modify/fork it using a text editor. Just remember to follow the GPL 3.0 license.

## üë®‚Äçüéì License
