## Online features
DFX Tweaker does not require an internet connection, however, some features like updating the script or posting an issue on GitHub can use your browser.

## About updates
Since DFX Tweaker does not require an Internet connection, updates must be downloaded manually, so check the Releases section from time to time if there is a new version.

**Although it doesn't appear anywhere, you should consider DFX Tweaker as a beta for now, because contain various bugs that will be solved.**

**Since the release of version 1.6, updates will arrive less frequently.**

## Required versions of Windows
- Required: Windows 10 (all) and Windows 11 (all)
- Recommended: Windows 10 1607 or newer for full functionality

## *About modified versions
You can modify the script to make it run on older versions of Windows, but there's no guarantee that everything will work as intended.

However, I'm open to solve bugs for modified versions, but I do not support these "officially"

## Other languages
DFX Tweaker is available in these languages:
- Spanish
- English

Since version 1.6, DFX Tweaker has multiple languages. Older releases are only in Spanish.

## Why DFX Tweaker?
Because I needed a tool to disable Windows Update and Defender, and I came across AikonCWD W10 Script, a small tool that did what I wanted with some other options.

However, the tool needed an internet connection for most of its functions, and I wanted to do something like that, but work without internet right out of the box. So the idea of making this project came up, of course, being as transparent as possible about the existence of Aikon and its fantastic script.

To download AikonCWD Script, scroll down a bit further.

## AikonCWD W10 Script
DFX Tweaker is a fork of AikonCWD W10 Script . Download it [**here**](https://github.com/aikoncwd/win10script).

Did you like the script? Well, don't congratulate me, congratulate [**AikonCWD**](https://github.com/aikoncwd) and by the way, do you want to buy him a beer? You can make a donation. :smile:
