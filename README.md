## Online features
DFX Tweaker does not require an internet connection, however, some features like updating the script or posting an issue on GitHub can use your browser.

## About updates
Since DFX Tweaker does not require an internet connection, updates must be downloaded manually, so check the Releases section from time to time if there is a new release.

WARNING: I do NOT take responsibility for what may happen to your system! All options and features just change some minor registry tweaks and/or disable some services, but anyway, be careful.

## System Requirements
- Required: Windows 10 (1507 or newer) and Windows 11
- Recommended: Windows 10 1809 or later
- 32-bit and 64-bit editions are supported

## About modified versions
You can modify the script to make it run on older versions of Windows, but there's no guarantee that everything will work as intended.

However, I'm open to solve bugs issued from modified versions, but I don't officially support these.

## Why DFX Tweaker?
Because I needed a tool to disable Windows Update and Defender, and I came across AikonCWD W10 Script, a small tool that did what I wanted with some other options.

However, the tool needed an internet connection for most of its functions, and I wanted to do something like that, but work without internet right out of the box. So the idea of making this project came up, of course, being as transparent as possible about the existence of Aikon and its fantastic script.

To download AikonCWD Script, scroll down a bit further.

## AikonCWD W10 Script
DFX Tweaker is a fork of AikonCWD W10 Script . Download it [**here**](https://github.com/aikoncwd/win10script) - **(Spanish)**

Did you like the script? Well, don't congratulate me, congratulate [**AikonCWD**](https://github.com/aikoncwd) who created the script that DFX Tweaker is based off.

## Source code
Altough DFX Tweaker is Open Source, there is no source code (sort of), you can just download any version of DFX Tweaker and edit it easily. However, you have to follow the GPL 3.0 license.

## License
DFX Tweaker is licensed under a GNU General Public License v3.0.

**As of November 14, 2022, all DFX Tweaker releases have been patched with the proper license**
