DFX Tweaker is a small and versatile tool designed to get system information and tweak your OS beyond what Microsoft allows you. As development progresses, new features will be added.

**If Microsoft Defender or SmartScreen flags the script as malware or virus, ignore it and try to run it again. Probably this has something to do with a command that disables Microsoft Defender, that's why disabling Microsoft Defender requires to reboot to Windows Safe Mode.**

## 🧀 Why DFX Tweaker?
Because I needed a tool to disable Windows Update and Defender, and I came across AikonCWD W10 Script, a small tool that did what I wanted with some other options.

However, the tool needed an internet connection for most of its functions, and I wanted to do something like that, but work without internet right out of the box. So the idea of making this project came up, of course, being as transparent as possible about the existence of Aikon and its fantastic script.

## 🧭 AikonCWD W10 Script
All releases up to 1.11.2 ESR were based off AikonCWD W10 Script . Download it [**here**](https://github.com/aikoncwd/win10script) - **(Spanish)**

Did you like the script? Well, don't congratulate me, congratulate [**AikonCWD**](https://github.com/aikoncwd) who created the script that DFX Tweaker was based off.
