### Online functions and dependencies
DFX Tweaker does not require an internet connection, however, some (optional) features can use your browser to open certain pages (ex: Releases on GitHub to download newer versions)

### About updates
Since DFX Tweaker does not require an Internet connection, updates must be downloaded manually, so check the Releases section from time to time if there is a new version.

Although it doesn't appear anywhere, you should consider DFX Tweaker as a beta for now, because it may contain bugs.

**Since the release of version 1.6, updates will arrive less frequently.**

### Availability in other languages
DFX Tweaker is available in these languages:
- Spanish
- English

### Why DFX Tweaker?
Because I needed a small tool to make some changes in Windows, and I came across AikonCWD Script, a small tool that did what I wanted.

However, the tool needed an internet connection for most of its functions, and I wanted to do something like that, but work without internet right out of the box. So the idea of ​​making this project came up, of course, being as transparent as possible about the existence of Aikon and its fantastic script.

To download AikonCWD Script, scroll down a bit further.

### AikonCWD W10 Script
DFX Tweaker is a fork of [**AikonCWD W10 Script**](https://github.com/aikoncwd/win10script). Download it here.

Did you like the script? Well, don't congratulate me, congratulate [**AikonCWD**](https://github.com/aikoncwd) and by the way, do you want to buy him a beer? You can make a donation. :smile:
