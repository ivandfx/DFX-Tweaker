### Why DFX Tweaker?
Because I needed a small tool to make some changes in Windows, and I came across AikonCWD Script, a small tool that did what I wanted.

However, the tool needed an internet connection for most of its functions, and I wanted to do something like that, but work without internet right out of the box. So the idea of ​​making this project came up, of course, being as transparent as possible about the existence of Aikon and its fantastic script.

To download AikonCWD Script, scroll down a bit further.

### AikonCWD Script
DFX Tweaker is a fork of [**AikonCWD Script**](https://github.com/aikoncwd/win10script). Download it here.

Did you like the script? Well, don't congratulate me, congratulate [**AikonCWD**](https://github.com/aikoncwd) and by the way, do you want to buy him a beer? You can make a donation. :smile:
